## Projects
1. [Project 1 of ALY 6000](Faizan_Project1_Script.R.R):
2. Introduction

Module 1 of ALY 6000 introduces the RStudio environment in which we solve a list of prescribed problems in R. The problems are designed to 
enable us to develop competency with statements, variable assignments, different expressions, vectors and their manipulation, matrices, 
functionality of R, and the installation and loading of packages in R.
The [project report](Faizan_Project1_Report.pdf.pdf) is available here.

Historical Overview 

R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing 
and graphics developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the 
University of Auckland, New Zealand, in the early 1990s. It is a 
successor of the S language and has gained tremendous popularity within the data science community as it is open-source and is equipped with
extensive libraries for statistical modeling and visualization.
The [project report](Faizan_Project2_Report.pdf) is available here.

2. [Project 2 of ALY 6000](Faizan_Project2.0.R): 

Module 2 Project of ALY 6000 was a two-part project in which I practiced working with different datasets. In Part One, I analyzed happiness and freedom indices from a range of countries. In Part Two, Major League Baseball provided the background for the data analysis.  I wrangled datasets through a range of operations, including column and row selection; data filtering, sorting, and augmenting. I have finally summarized the data utilizing built-in descriptive statistics. After completing the R script, I included the analysis and my final conclusion in a report.
